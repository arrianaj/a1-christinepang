#### Q1: What are the “Combined” fields referring to? How do you think this information may affect our analyses?

The "Combined" fields refer to whether or not the PG&E energy datasets met the Commission Decision aggregation requirements regarding the minimum number of Residential and Non-Residential customers and their respective contributions to total consumption. If the aggregation was not met, consumption data was combined with that from neighboring zip codes until the requirement was satisfied, indicated by "Y" in the cell. Combining data across different zip codes could cause our analyses on energy consumption in a region to be not representative of the actual consumption in the particular zip code listed.



#### Q2: Why are the “Average” fields likely not useful for our analyses?

The "Average" fields are not likely useful for our analyses because we are more interested in how total energy use is distributed spatially (by zip code) rather than what the average energy consumption per customer per zip code is.



#### Q3: What type of calculations should "X" and "Y" be in the step above? Why?





#### Q4: What is the total KBTU combined electricity and gas consumption in PG&E territory in 2017? What is the average annual electricity consumption per customer, and average annual gas consumption per customer?

The PG&E data files double count the month of September (month 9) in the Q3 and Q4 reports, so I only used the September results from the Q3 report and deleted those from the Q4 report. The total KBTU combined electricity and gas consumption in PG&E territory for the Residential Customer Class in 2017 is 2.7371E+11 KBTU. The average annual electricity consumption per customer is ????



#### Q5: How would you explain the results of this chart to an average property owner in Northern California? What would be the value of conducting further "seasonal" analyses of energy use, compared to "year-long" analyses, and how would you define seasonal boundaries?

The chart results indicate that residents in Northern California use the most gas in the winter months (around November – April). This is due to colder weather causing residents to use their heaters more. The electricity usage is roughly constant throughout the year but slightly greater in the summer months of July and August. This is because while summer months are hotter than the rest of the year, northern California generally does not experience extremely hot temperatures, so people won’t use their air conditioners as much.
“Seasonal” analyses of energy use would be beneficial to better understand the fluctuations of energy use within a season or month(s) because we can see that it changes drastically throughout the year, so any action proposed to change energy use should depend on the season. Comparatively, a “year-long” analysis would only report energy consumed over the whole year and would not be able to differentiate between months of the year that contain the largest energy usage. 
For Northern California, I would define seasonal boundaries based on the amount gas and electicity used in a month along with its rate of change over the year. Winter is December - February, which has the highest gas usage. Spring is March – May (gas usage decreases), Summer is June – August (gas usage stabilizes, electricity usage increases), and Fall is September – November (gas usage increased, electricity usage decreases).
